# Getting Started
## Set your goals
I know, I know - this step sounds a little "motivational speaker-y", but it is actually important.
You need to decide what you want to accomplish, and how quickly you want to accomplish it, because that will help inform your decisions later on.
**You know that you want to fly - that's a given.**  Let's try to answer some more detailed questions:
- What do you want to fly?
	- I want to fly Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)
		- This will require a Sport Pilot Certification
	- I want to fly Single-engine Land Aircraft
		- This will only require a Private Pilot Certification
	- I want to fly larger, Multi-engine Land Aircraft
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* and Multi-engine Rating (ME)
	- I want to fly Single-engine Sea Aircraft
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* and Sea Aircraft Rating
- When do you want to fly?
	- I'll only fly on perfect, sunny days
		- Your Sport or Private Certification will cover this
	- I want to be able to deal with poor weather or fly at night
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* and an Instrument Rating (IR)
My instructor **higly** recommended earning an Instrument Rating - even if I was fairly certain I would only fly on perfect days. Freak weather happens (especially here in the Midwest), so he wanted me to be able to deal with it - and I completely agreed with him.

## Choose your Instructor
Your choice of a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) is important and you may need to "interview" more than one before you find the right fit.
Here are a few things you should ask:
- How many years have you been flying?
	- How many hours?
- How long have you been an instructor?
- How many students have you had?
- What percentage of your students pass the FAA Checkride?
	- Of those, how many passed on the first attempt?
I found that most of the CFIs I spoke to answered these questions before I could even ask them - which made it a little easier on me.

## Ground School
Ground school is the classroom-style education involved with flight lessons.
You can start ground school whenever you would like, but the knowledge you gain during Ground School will be immediately applicable to your first flight lesson, so getting a jump start wuldn't be a bad thing!

There is a lot of information out there about which method is best - in-classroom or online.
Your CFI will probably have a preference, but the Online courses are extremely popular - both for the competitive price and accessibility.  In my situation, I was advised by my CFI and other friends to investigate the online options.  Look at the **Online Ground School** section for more information.

Which 

### Online Ground School
In the world of Online Flight Training, there are two or three major players:
- [Sporty's Pilot Shop](https://sportys.com)
- [King Schools](https://kingschools.com)
- [Gleim Aviation](https://gleimaviation.com)
My CFI recommended Sporty's, and highly recommended adding on the Instrument Rating (IR) course, so I chose [this package](https://www.sportys.com/private-and-instrument-rating-course-combo.html) package ($399.00).
[This package](https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly-course-private-pilot-test-prep-online-app-and-tv.html) is slightly cheaper ($249.00), but does not include the IR Course - so if you're planning to earn your Instrument Rating, you would save money by selecting the compbination package.

## Before your first flight lesson
1. Set up a MedXpress Account
	- Navigate to https://medxpress.faa.gov/medxpress
	- Request an Account
	- Fill out an application for a **Airman Medical and Student Pilot** medical examination
	- At the end you will be issued an appointment confirmation number
      - Keep track of this number, because you will need it for your Medical Examination
2. Set up an IACRA Account
   - Navigate to https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/default.aspx
   - Start a new **Student Pilot** application
   - At the end of this application, it will suggest that you have you CFI review before submitting
   - You will be issued an FAA Tracking Number (FTN)
     - Keep track of this. This identifies you to the FAA, and it will be assigned for the entirety of your aviation career
     - You will need to provide this to your CFI so that they can complete your application
3. Schedule a 3rd Class Medical Examination
	- Navigate to https://designee.faa.gov/#/designeeLocator
	- Select an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) from the list offered in your area
	- Schedule a **3rd Class Medical Examination**, providing the appointment confirmation
