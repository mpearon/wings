# Wings
For as long as I can remember, I've been interested in everything related to flight.<br />
After years of putting it off, I've decided I'm going to get started.  I'll do my best to chronical my journey through the world of aviation here.
<br />
My hope is that something I write here will either inspire someone else to get started, help someone along on a path they've already started or just give someone a bit to read.<br />
