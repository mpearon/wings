# Wings
For as long as I can remember, I've been interested in everything related to flight.<br />
After years of putting it off, I've decided I'm going to get started.  I'll do my best to chronicle my journey through the world of aviation here.
<br />
My hope is that something I write here will either inspire someone else to get started, help someone along on a path they've already started or just give someone a bit to read.<br />
<br />

> **An unwelcome hiatus**<br />
Unfortunately, (due to poor forecasts, scheduling conflicts on my CFI's side, then more conflicts on my side) it looks like I'll be unable to fly again until possibly early June. My concern is that this will require a lesson or two for review - which means greater expense.
