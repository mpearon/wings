## Ground School
- [Sporty's Pilot Shop](https://sportys.com/): This is the online ground school that I used.
	- I cover this in the [How to get started](../gettingstarted.md) document.
- [r/flying](https://reddit.com/r/flying): A subreddit dedicated to all things aviation.
	- This site has a lot of great information from people that are either already pilots, or are on the same journey you are. It really helped to read stories of people that struggled with the same information or process that I did.
- [Fly 8MA](https://fly8ma.com): Offers free ground school training
	- I used fly8MA's free [Private Pilot 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1v7KYjjtCI&list=PLnjaM9eVs4pvHFgcSAkepEbWwQpGtbY5c) videos ahead of my ground school to gain a rudimentary understanding of flight. 
	- Useless information: Fly8MA is based out of the local airport of where my family used to vacation every year - [KVNC in Venice, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Municipal_Airport). Lots of great scenery to take in throughout these videos.
