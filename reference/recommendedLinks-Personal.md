# Training
## Ground School
- [Sporty's Pilot Shop](https://sportys.com/): This is the online ground school that I used.
	- I cover this in the [How to get started](../gettingstarted.md) document.
- [Fly 8MA](https://fly8ma.com): Offers free ground school training
	- I used fly8MA's free [Private Pilot 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1v7KYjjtCI&list=PLnjaM9eVs4pvHFgcSAkepEbWwQpGtbY5c) videos ahead of my ground school to gain a rudimentary understanding of flight. 
	- Useless information: Fly8MA is based out of the local airport of where my family used to vacation every year - [KVNC in Venice, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Municipal_Airport). Lots of great scenery to take in throughout these videos.
- [Airplane Ground Schools](http://airplanegroundschools.com)
# Flight Planning Resources
## Apps
- [ForeFlight](https://www.foreflight.com/): An Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)

## Others
- [r/flying](https://reddit.com/r/flying): A subreddit dedicated to all things aviation.
	- This site has a lot of great information from people that are either already pilots, or are on the same journey you are. It really helped to read stories of people that struggled with the same information or process that I did.
- [ASA CX-3 Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=q09al3xeLs): A video about how to use the ASA CX-3 for your practical exam
	- For your practical exam, you're allowed to use a flight calculator. I chose the [ASA CX-3](https://www.sportys.com/asa-cx-3-flight-computer.html) for some of it's options, but there are other options - all of which are fairly similar. This video goes over how you will use the different functions of the CX-3 to solve the exam questions.
