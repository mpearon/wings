# Abort Plan Briefing
1. We'll turn onto Runway [ _____ ] and see full power and green engine gauges. This will be a [ static | rolling ] takeoff.
2. If there's a problem before rotation we'll abort and stop on the runway.
3. If we're not airborne by [ _____ ], we'll go to idle power and stop on the runway.
4. If we have a problem after liftoff with runway remaining, we will go to idle power and full flaps, then land straight ahead on the remaining runway.
5. If we have a problem below 500' AGL, we'll point the nose down and land generally straight ahead, turning only to avoid obstacles.
6. If we have a problem above 500' AGL and below 1000' AGL we have an option turning left of right for a better landing site - possibly even returning to the airport.
7. If we have a problem once we're at or above pattern altitude, we will return to the airport if we are within gliding distance. If not, we will select a suitable forced landing site.
