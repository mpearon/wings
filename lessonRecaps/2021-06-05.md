# Lesson Review
## Preflight
The preflight procedures are getting easier and easier for me to keep straight. Using ForeFlight's Checklist functionality is really helpful because it gives me a box to tick versus trying to keep my place on a laminated sheet.
## Takeoff
There were several of these today, but I'll talk about the first for now.

After weeks of listening to radio communications on YouTube and trying to pay attention to my CFI, I had finally worked up enough nerve to actually make the radio calls this time.

> "JEF ground, Warrior 8248T on ramp with numbers, ready for taxi"

Sounds pretty good, right? Well, it would have been great if Ground had received the message. Something was up with my side of the radio, so my CFI ended up having to repeat my radio transmission. When we finished up the run-up and called for takeoff clearance, Tower mentioned that while they could hear me, it was distorted and they suspected the magnetos were interfering.

Clearance received, we headed up the runway and into the air!  No issues to report.
## Manuevers
We spent 2.5 hours reviewing stalls, learning how to perform Steep Turns (so far, these are my favorite), Turns around a point and S-Turns over a road.

The Steep Turns and S-Turns went pretty well, but I did struggle with the Turns around a point a bit. My CFI told me that this was really just the introduction, so I didn't need to beat myself up over that one. I'll get better at them with some more practice.
## Landing
After buzzing around for a bit, we headed back to the airport to shoot some landings! This went better than I thought it was going to, actually.

We did 8 Touch-and-Gos!<br />
For the most part, I was able to guide the airplane in the traffic pattern and keep it pointed fairly straight down the runway. The trickiest bit for me was keeping the nose pointed down through base and final - I instinctively wanted to climb.<br />
The crosswind was a little bit of a chore as well - even if it was only 8kts!
# Last Thoughts
I loved the extra time that I was able to spend in the air today. I've been told that after a certain amount of time in a plane, students' eyes tend to "glaze over" - and I don't think mine ever did - or if they did, my CFI never mentioned it.

One thing that I do need to work on is my fine motor skills.  My CFI said I was over-correcting for the wind a bit - which obviously exacerbates the issue.  More time spent in the pattern will beat this out of me, I'm sure.
