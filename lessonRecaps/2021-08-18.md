# Lesson Review
Today was another day spent hopping between non-towered airports.

Yesterday, my CFI (John) was working with another CFI's (Chad) student (Chandler) to get her ready for her first solo and today was more of the same - so Chad and I spent more time practicing non-towered airport operations, decent planning and pattern entry planning.

First off, we headed northeast to an airport I had never been to before: Mexico's [KMYJ][L0].
> *I'm still young in my aviation career, so a new airport is still an exciting thing for me - as is adding a new plane to my roster. Hopefully the novelty sticks around for many years to come!*
On our way, Chad walked me through the process of getting flight following - which I had seen (and was confused by) only once before, so it was good to go through the process again.<br />
[KMYJ][L0] is a small airport with no taxiways on one of the runways, so if you're doing a full-stop then plan to take back off, you have to back-taxi the runway. The approach and landing were decent - not quite as soft as I would have liked, but passable. This was a Touch-and-Go, so we retracted the flaps, applied full power and took right back off.

We intended to head to Fulton's [KFTT][L3], but there was a bit of traffic coming in, so Chad decided to divert us to [1H3][L1], so I got to add another airport to my list!<br />
In between the approach calls, Chad had me plan the entry to runway 27 - based on the direction we were coming from, I decided on overflying the field, then a teardrop into the left downwind.
> If you remember my last entry, I mentioned that this was a really cool phrase to say/hear - and I got it right this time!
There wasn't much to say about the Touch-and-Go here - just that the landing was firm again. I guess I need to polish my flare a bit.

Next we headed to Eldon's [H79][L2].<br />
I've been to this airport, so I'm familiar with the pattern, altitudes and surroundings. This made it simple to spot the airport and get into the pattern for a Touch-and-Go on runway 18. This landing was pretty good.

After a downwind departure from H79, we headed back toward home: KJEF.
# Last Thoughts
Today was another good day of learning. With Chad's input and guidance from yesterday, I was able to make all of the approach/intent calls without issue and appropriately plan my descents and entries. I still need a bit of work on the flight following procedures, but I think I could sort that out with another trip for practice.
