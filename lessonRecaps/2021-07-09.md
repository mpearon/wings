# Lesson Review
As is the usual these days, I spent the entire time flying rectangles around the airport, trying to nail the perfect landing.  Fast forwarding a bit.
## Landing
My CFI (John Swan) had the opportunity to go fly an old warplane, so he jumped on it (understandably!). Instead of canceling my lesson, he handed me off to one of his fellow CFIs (Chad Grosvenor).<br />
Chad and I went around the traffic pattern 17 times today - and I'm not sure I improved very much.  Sure, there were a few good landings - but not nearly enough in my opinion.<br />
My biggest issue today was flaring too aggressively - but just at the very last second. I would get within inches of the runway then start gaining altitude. I was able to set it down, but it was still frustrating.
# Last Thoughts
**126 Landings**
My logbook (and ForeFlight) tell me that I have 126 landings. To me, it feels like I should have them pretty smooth by now - but I don't and I hate it.<br />
According my spreadsheets, I am (in monetary terms) halfway through my training. If things don't starting coming together soon, I'll have to make a decision.  I've already invested a significant amount of money into this incredibly expensive hobby - so I need to be realistic about where my skills are landing on the scale of "Not a Pilot" to "Pilot".

Also - I was an absolute idiot and didn't take Written Knowledge Test (PAR) immediately after ground school, so now I'm playing catch up and spending hours taking Practice Exams.  If I come away from this with any recommendations at all it will be to not procrastinate - you'll hate yourself for it.
