# Lesson Review
Due to a combination of weather and scheduling, today's lesson was cancelled.  We called it early in the day, so the METAR isn't available at the time of publishing.
# Last Thoughts
Again, the weather is dashing my dreams aloft.  I have another lesson scheduled for tomorrow morning, so hopefully the rain clears up a bit!
