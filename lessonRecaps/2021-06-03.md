# Lesson Review
**FINALLY AIRBORNE!**

Man, that felt good.  Due to scheduling conflicts and the weather (the real villain here), it had been almost two months (2021-04-13) since my last flight. As I suspected would be the case, that made this a review lesson - but I'm going to have to say that I'm pretty happy with the way it worked out.

## Preflight
No issues to report here.  I was able to use my newly built FOreFlight checklist, which really seemed to help me keep track of where I was easier.

## Taxi
My taxiing game was strong today.  I was able to hold the lines well, maintain a "brisk walk" pace and place the plane with confidence. I noticed that when I stopped at the hold short, I must have been applying uneven pressure to the pedals, because at the last second, the plane turned to the left a bit.

## Takeoff
I felt like I was more authoritative with the throttle (which was something I was "babying" a bit) and I felt like I kept the centerline pretty well.  The climb and turn-out was uneventful (which seems like a great thing in aviation). My climb attitude was a bit extreme, so I'll need to work on that a bit.

## Manuevers
As this was a review lesson, we didn't focus on any particular thing - we just flew the plane. That being said, I was able to hold my altitude and heading really well today - and I made a point of looking outside the plane for directional reference and not focusing on the instruments.

My CFI had me pull a few standard rate turns and navigate to specific headings - which I had done before. That gave me the opportunity to "play" with the plane a bit - fiddling the controls here and there, learning how the plane reacted to various inputs.

## Landing
On the first touch-and-go, my CFI had me follow through with him while he controlled everything so I could feel everything. For the the second and third, I controlled the directionality of plane in the pattern while he manned the throttle and flaps.

# Last Thoughts
Everything about the lesson today felt stronger - and that made me feel great. After quite a bit of frustration (again - the weather hates me), it was awesome to get back into the air.  For my next lesson, I'm hoping to practice a few stalls, an emergency landing and actually shoot a landing.
