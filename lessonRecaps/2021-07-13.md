# Lesson Review
I bet you can't guess what I did today.

*Yep* - more landings.
## Landing
My normal CFI returned from his trip, so we climbed into the cockpit to fly around the pattern a few times.

Although there were a few "firm" landings, they were all passable - which is the biggest point of the training, I guess! My CFI did notice that I wasn't quite getting the power all the way to idle in the flare which was making me "light on the wheels".

On one of the approaches I was high, so I attempted a slip to landing, but wasn't quite aggressive enough, so I'll need to do that a few more times to get comfortable with the feeling.
# Last Thoughts
It feels like these entries are getting shorter - and I guess that is a good thing.  I'm getting used to the processes, so they aren't interesting enough to mention anymore.<br />
I know that sounds bad - like I'm bored, but I promise that isn't the case. I like being familiar with a process.

A little news on the Solo Readiness Front: my CFI handed me a Pre-solo Written Exam at the end of today's lesson! He sent me a copy of the Operating Handbook, pointed me to the FAR and AIM and sent me on my way!<br />
[Here](../reference/other/pre-soloWrittenExam.md) is a copy of the test and my answers.
