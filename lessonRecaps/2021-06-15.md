# Lesson Review
## Preflight
No issues to report in the preflight.
> JEF Ground, Warrior 43060 on ramp with numbers, requesting taxi
> Good evening, 43060, taxi to 12 via alpha 1 alpha

Off to the run-up area we went!
> JEF Tower, Warrior 43060 holding short of 12 at alpha, ready for departure
> 060, right turn approved, state direction of departure
> Southwest, 060
## Takeoff
I lined up on the runway, verified heading and runway were in agreement, set the power to full, and began verifying gauges as we accelerated toward our rotation speed of 60kts. At 60kts, I applied sufficient back pressure to to yoke to get us airborne, then leveled out to gain a little airspeed. I pitched for an 80kt climb, an at 500' AGL, I turned to heading 230 and continued the climb to 3500' MSL.
## Manuevers
Once I leveled us off at 3500' (actually slightly above, because I got distracted and overshot a bit), I turned to 270 degrees then performed a couple of clearing turns.<br />
Next, I set up for slow flight: I set the power to 1500 RPM, waited for V<sub>FE</sub> before extending the flaps, waiting for 55kts and setting the power to 2000 RPM and settling into slow flight.<br />
At this point, we executed standard rate turns to the right and left, to north and south respectively.

After that, we ran through a couple power off and power on stalls.

Next we performed a steep turn toward a training area where we performed S-turns and Turns around a point.<br />
I was decently pleased with the way these went - although there wasn't much wind to complicate them much.  Hopefully there will be a slight breeze tomorrow.
## Landing
After we played around with the ground reference manuevers, we headed back toward the airport to get a little practice in the traffic pattern.<br />
We shot about 9 landings and it felt like I got more comfortable with the procedures with each attempt.  My CFI took the opportunity to demonstrate a power off 180 - and then a forward slip when I came in a little high.
# Last Thoughts
I'm excited to get more time in the pattern!  I look forward to the point where every step becomes simple for me.  I know it will never be an "idle" activity, but I want it to be second nature.
