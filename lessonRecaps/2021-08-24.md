# Lesson Review
**Cross Country Time!**<br />
In preparation for my upcoming solo cross country flight, my CFI and I "rehearsed" the flight, taking the exact route that I will flying during our next scheduled lesson.

So, after all of the usual preparations, we exited the pattern to the north west - bound for [Mexico's KMBY][L0].<br />
Once we received clearance to change frequencies, we hopped over to MIZZU Approach (124.375) and requested Flight Following.
>*MIZZU Approach, Warrior 43060*<br />
>*Warrior 43060, MIZZU Approach, state request*<br />
>*Request VFR Flight Following from KJEF to KMBY at 4500', 43060*<br />
>*43060, squawk 4712*<br />
>*4712, 43060*<br />
>*Warrior 43060, radar contact, 13 miles north west of Jefferson City airport*
Simple enough! I was following along much better this time than I was last time and it was all making more sense.

We buzzed along toward our intermediate airport, chatting along the way about how to handle certain situations, how to respond to specific calls and a multitude of other things aviation-related.

Once we were within 15 miles of KMBY (and had gotten the weather), my CFI started questioning me on how I was planning to enter the pattern - and in this case, I selected a simple 45Â° entry into the left downwind for runway 23. We started making our approach/intent calls, and descending toward pattern altitude.
>***Note:** I'm not sure if I've mentioned this or not, but my CFI showed be a great way method of descent planning:<br />
> **3 miles per 1000' feet of decent**<br />
> so, if I'm cruising at 4500' the destination airport's pattern altitude is 1900' and I want to arrive at pattern altitude 4 miles before the airport, the math on this looks like:<br />
><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\big(\big(\frac{(4500 - 1900)}{1000}\big) \times 3\big) %2B 4"><br />
> So, I would determine that at 11.8nm (rounded to 12nm) from the airport I would begin my 90kt/500fpm descent.*

We entered the pattern, making our intent calls along the way and I set the plane down (a bit too hard) on the runway before applying full power to head back to KJEF.

On the way back, we picked up flight following again. They gave us the runaround at the very end of our flight, so we ended up cancelling radar service and informing KJEF directly.
# Last Thoughts
**I think I have this.**<br />
I'm slightly concerned that I'll mess up a call on the radio, but my CFI reminded me that I have a magic phrase in my arsenal: "Student Pilot".  I'll try my absolute hardest to not have to employ that trick, but with as friendly as the controllers are on Flight Following, it probably wouldn't end up being that big of a deal.

Anyway - I'm off to do some flight planning!
