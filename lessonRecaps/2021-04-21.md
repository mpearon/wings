# Lesson Review
**Weather, yet again.**<br />
This will be the third failed attempt at Lesson 4 - which is *extremely* frustrating...but that is what I get for living in the Midwest.

This time, it was mostly down to the wind. We had a bit of rain earlier in the day, but that seems to have quit for the day - although there are some pretty ominous-looking clouds hanging around.

So, I'll spend some time tonight taking more FAA Practice Exams and getting used to my Plotter and Flight Computer - then we'll try again next week.

> **Note:** As was the case yesterday, we called this one early due to the current conditions.

# Last Thoughts
The weather is *not* your friend.
