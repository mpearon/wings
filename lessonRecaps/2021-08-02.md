# Lesson Review
**FIRST SOLO!**<br />
FINALLY!  It has been a long time coming, and the day is finally here!  I'll get right into it.
## Landing
After my CFI looped around the traffic pattern about 13 times (pretty uneventful), he asked if I was ready to go solo...and of course I said yes!

After a quick stop to empty the left seat, I called for clearance and headed back toward the taxiway. My CFI was standing by with his radio in hand, just in case I needed some guidance. Thankfully, there were only two times he needed to chime in for: 1) to warn the the controllers that this was a Student Solo and 2) to compliment a couple of my landings!

I shot 5 landings by myself, 3 full-stop taxi back landings and 1 Touch-and-Go before going full-stop to the ramp.
# Last Thoughts
If we really look at things, save for a slight weight reduction, there isn't any real difference between your first solo pattern and the dual pattern right before it. On paper, that's absolutely accurate - and until today, my analytical brain would have supported that statement. Post-solo, I'm going to tell you that whatever is written on the afore mentioned paper is utter nonsense.

Honestly, I wasn't all that nervous about my solo. I usually am anxious about things in general...but this wasn't one of them for some reason. Right about the time I lined up for final on my first circuit there was a moment where that changed a bit.<br />
I realized that the safety net that I had grown accustomed to wasn't in the seat next to me. As good as my CFI is at his job, there was absolutely nothing he could do if I messed this up...*I was alone.*

I think the firm clicking noise that the flap lever makes must have kicked those doubts from my mind, because I set my last notch of flaps and landed the plane - **all by myself**.

**Man, that was stinking awesome!** I went around a few more times, with the smile on my face growing wider with each circuit. One of my favorites was when my CFI complimented a couple of my landings over the Tower frequency. It's one thing to have your CFI compliment you in the cockpit - but it's different when it happens on a public frequency were *everyone* can hear it.

> **I have a video to show you.**<br />
> <del>Once I get it edited, I'll toss a link on here.</del>Unfortunately, the audio port I had the GoPro plugged into wasn't turned up (not pleased about that one), so I don't have any proof that my CFI was nice to me. You'll just have to take my word for it.

[Here](https://youtu.be/5AMr2JNpM9o) is a link to the video!

After I got back to the ramp and shut things down, my CFI walked out to the plane, shook my hand, congratulated me, took a photo and then we headed to the newly built on-airport restaurant to celebrate with a bit of lunch.
