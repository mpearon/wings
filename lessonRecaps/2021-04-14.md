# Lesson Review
Another day ruined by the wind!<br />
The temperature was great and the sun bathing the tarmac is it's rays, but the wind was very gusty - to the point that it was almost too cold to be outside.

Not one to waste an opportunity, I spent a few hours at the airport, learning how to tie down the airplanes, and sitting in the sadly stationary cockpit of my favorite plane (N8248T), running through the various checklists. I also went through the motions of the power off stall - which I had been rehearsing all day in preparation for today's flight. *Sigh.*

# Last Thoughts
I hate the wind.  There's always next week, I guess!
