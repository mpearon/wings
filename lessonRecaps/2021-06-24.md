# Lesson Review
**Today was another good day.**<br />
Two good days in a row seems like a bit much to ask for - but I'll take it!
## Preflight
No issues to speak of here - everything was working as expected.
## Takeoff
No issues on takeoff - simple, simple!
## Manuevers
We were going to be spending time in the traffic pattern today, so no specific manuevers were planned...but we did get to have a little fun.  I'll get to that in the next section.
## Landing
We performed 9 Touch-ad-Gos today, for a total of 10 takeoffs and landings.<br />
According to my CFI, my approaches were spot on and a few of my landings were really good!  This is exactly what I I've been wanting to hear (it would have been nice to have heard it a few lessons ago, but I'm still pleased).<br />
One of the best parts of today was when my CFI had a conversation with the Tower over the radio.  I might not be getting it 100% right, but it was something like this:

> "JEF Tower, do you have time for a request?"
> "Yes, go ahead."
> "Are you familiar with a Pattern Cocktail?"
> "I am."
> "I'll have one of those, please."

KJEF is a small airport, so everyone knows everyone and everyone seems to get along - to the point that occasionally there will be some teasing over the radio on occasion. I was focused on flying the airplane, so I didn't  I just kind of assumed that my CFI was joking about how he might need a drink after our flight...as it turns out, this actually means "throw something unexpected at my student to see if has a heart attack".

Just as I was established on my next downwind, I heard the following call:
> "3060, immediate right 360"

It took me a second to process, but I acknowledged the call, tried really hard to remember which was was right, then banked into a right 360.  I looked at my CFI for a bit of guidance. He praised me for my prompt response, then told me that this manuever might be used by Tower to create separation.  Once I was back in line, he told me to let Tower know.

> "JEF Tower, Reestablished, 3060"

On the next round, I was given the instruction for an immediate short final.<br />
My CFI reached over and set the power to idle, informing me that I had lost my engine.  He instructed me to take a *very* early turn toward the runway and start lining up for my "emergency landing".  I bounced on this landing, but I was able to recover it by increasing power slightly to settle back down to the runway.
# Last Thoughts
I think I'm pretty close to getting landings sorted.  I know I'll never be perfect, but I'm going to keep trying to get close!<br />
My CFI ran though a pre-solo checklist, so I think I'm getting pretty close to that as well - which is pretty exciting!
