# Lesson Review
This was my first official lesson - so due to a combination of over-preparedness, excitement and a slight case of "first flight nerves", I showed up to the airport about an hour early - but that was just fine. I love to watch the traffic, listen to the radio chatter and just be around planes and pilots in general.<br />
As I left work and headed toward the airport, everything thing felt fine - but by the time I arrived at the airport, I was starting to notice the wind - *very* gusty. As I was sitting around outside the FBO, I heard an incoming plane contact the KJEF tower, announcing that they were downwind of Runway 12.  Since I fancy myself an aspiring aviator, I decided that I was going to spot this airplane ahead of it's final. I looked at the runway position (remembering that unless otherwise specified, it would be a left-hand traffic pattern), and determined that from where I was positioned, the airplane would appear on the opposite side of the runway, flying from my right to my left.<br />
On paper, I might have been correct - but I didn't end up seeing that airplane until it was on final.  I watched the plane muscle it's way through the wind gusts and onto the tarmac, lurching this way and that a bit, but for the most part a pretty uneventful landing. The pilot rolled to the taxiway hold line, paused for clearance, then taxied to the GA parking area. To my surprise, the first person to climb out of that little airplane was John Swan, my CFI. Later on, he bragged a bit about how good that landing actually was, considering the conditions.<br />
Unfortunately, due to the fact that he had to fight to get that plane on the ground earlier, John decided that we wouldn't be getting in the air today - the wind was just too much. Since we were both at the airport and we had the time, John decided that we would go through a very thorough preflight.  Not quite what I was expecting out of the day, but hey - it's a start!<br />
## Onboarding Documentation
John and I went over billing; the syllabus for the lesson plans; and he provided documentation for the school, airport and the airplane we would be using for the training: the Piper PA-28-161 piperWarrior. We also discussed the Pre-flight Briefing, Abort Plan Briefing and Passenger Briefing.
## Preflight Checklist
### Approach
- Our preflight checklist procedures began as we approached the plane.  We looked for oil puddles, major structural issues - just anything that was obviously wrong. This is a unique vantage point during your preflight checks and gives you a great overall view of the aircraft.
### Documentation
- Enter the cabin and retrieve the checklist
- Next, we checked for the required documentation using the **AROW** acronym
	- **A**: Airworthiness Certificate
		- This was on the back wall of the cabin
	- **R**: Registration Certificate
		- This was with the Airworthiness certificate on the back wall of the cabin
	- **O**: Operating Handbook (a.k.a.: Pilot's Operating Handbook / POH)
		- This was in the seat back compartment of the copilots seat.
	- **W**: Weight and Balance Information
		- This was in the POH binder
### Electronics and Avionics
- Toggle on the Master Switch and engage all lights
	- Beacon Light
	- Landing Light
	- Anti-collision Lights
	- Navigation Lights
	- Instrument Lights
- Before exiting the cabin
	- Verify all instrument lights are lit
	- Verify fuel gauges are indicating fuel levels
- Walk around the exterior of the aircraft anti-clockwise to visibly verify each of the lights are active, returning to original position
	- Rear Stabilizer
		- Beacon Light
			- Red, atop the vertical stabilizer
			- should be blinking or rotating
	- Right Wing
		- Navigation Light
			- Green, front wingtip
			- Should be solid
		- Anti-collision Strobe
			- White, mid-wingtip
			- Should be blinking
	- Front
		- Landing Light
			- Bright white light beneath spinner
			- Should be solid
	- Left Wing
		- Navigation Light
			- Red, front wingtip
			- Should be solid
		- Anti-collision Strobe
			- White, mid-wingtip
			- Should be blinking
	- Rear Stabilizer
		- Navigation Light
			- White, rear of stabilizer
- Return to cabin and disengage all lights
### Exterior and Fuel
- Retrieve Fuel Sampler
- Lower Flaps
- Open pilot window flap
- Working your way around the airplane anti-clockwise, check the following
	- Right Wing
		- Flap
			- Down
			- Firm
			- Linkages have play, but are not too loose
			- Hinges are in good condition and do not have major gaps
			- Same is true of underside
		- Aileron
			- Moves freely
			- Verify yoke movement
			- Verify opposite aileron inverse movement

## Instrument Basics
John and I walked through the standard 6-pack, reviewing the use of each instrument and the redundant use of each.
## Wrap-up
John and I walked through the FBO and I learned about the filing system, where the various offices were and a few people's names. At the end of all of my questions and a quick discussions about the weather, John added the FAA endorsement to my logbook and logged 1.5 hours of Ground Training.
# Last Thoughts
As disappointing as it was to not be able to fly today, there was still a lot of great information for me to review and absorb. My next scheduled flight day is in two days, but from what the forecasts are saying, I'll be sitting that one out as well.
