# Lesson Review
Another good landing day!
## Landing
**Good news! My landings are *still* alright!**

14 circuits around the traffic pattern today, and I'm pleased to say that my landings were all pretty solid.  One was pretty firm, so there's still a little work to be done there - and I'm still crossing the threshold with a tad too much airspeed (causing the occasional balloon), so I would like to shore that up a bit (in preparation for short field).
# Last Thoughts
Due to a scheduling conflict at the flight school, I ended up adding another plane to my ForeFlight listing: A 1996 Piper Cherokee Archer III.  The Archer is the same airframe as the Warrior with a slightly upgraded interior, some exterior panel differences and 20 extra horsepower, bringing it to 181HP versus the Warrior's 161HP.

Due to the fact that I was unfamiliar with the Archer, I opted to not solo today, but my CFI said that the next time I fly (which will not be next week, unfortunately), I will be going solo!
