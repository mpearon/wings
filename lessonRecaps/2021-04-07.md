# Lesson Review
Today was full of rain, thunder and a bit of lightning - all of which cleared up right before my scheduled flight time. Of course, by this time we had already called the day a lost cause.
# Last Thoughts
The weather is a cruel mistress. My next scheduled flight day is in two days (2021-04-09) - here is to favorable weather patterns!
