# Lesson Review
**It's go time!** I was excited as I left for the airport - I had reviewed the latest METAR and the weather was looking great - and I was feeling good.<br />
As I got further down the road, my heart started to sink. You see, my home airport (KJEF) sits right on the other side of a river - which means fog. It was incredibly thick as I crossed the bridge and pulled into the airport's parking area. After a couple of no-flight days, I was really hoping to get in the air.

Right after I parked my car I opened up ForeFlight to see what the latest weather report was saying. I was greeted by a ```SPECI``` indicating IFR conditions. *Great.*<br />
After stewing for a bit, I noticed my CFI (John Swan) pull into the parking lot, so I headed over to meet with him. After a quick discussion and quickly finishing up with my IACRA Student Pilot Certificate approval, he decided that we should go ahead and start our preflight because he was convinced the fog was going to dissipate soon. So we grabbed the keys, made note of the current Tachometer reading, then headed out to the plane.<br />

## The Preflight
- As I approached the plane, I looked for anything obviously wrong and verified tie-downs and chocks
	- *No obvious issues and tie downs and chocks were not present*
- I opened up the cabin and checked for the appropriate documentation using the **A.R.O.W.** initialism
	- *All documentation was accounted for*
- I then toggled on the Master Switch, followed by the appropriate light switches/rheostats, ensuring that all instruments were lit and the fuel gauges were indicating
	- *Everything was functioning as expected*
- I quickly walked the perimeter of the plane, verifying that all lights were operating as desired
	- *All exterior lights were working*
- I returned to the cabin; toggled off the electrics; lowered the flaps; and grabbed the checklist
- I began with the right wing, checking flaps, ailerons, surface condition, struts and vents
	- *Flap was firm, aileron moved freely, hinges and linkages were intact, surfaces were good, struts looked good and vents were clear*
- Moving on to the front, I checked the right engine compartment and oil level, air inlets, spinner, propeller, windshield and left engine compartment
	- *Belts and wires were intact, no animal traces in any openings, oil level was good, right compartment door was secured, propeller edges were smooth, all screws/rivets were present, windshield was clean,  hydraulic fluid level was good and the left compartment door was secured*
- I then moved on to the left wing, checking vents, struts, surface condition, ailerons and flaps
	- *Vents were clear, struts looked good, surfaces were good, aileron moved freely, hinges and linkages were intact and flap was firm*
- I checked the left rear fuselage for warped panels
	- *Nothing to report*
- I checked the left empennage, Rear Stabilizer, Rudder and Stabilator
	- *The rudder was firm, the stabilator moved freely and hinges and linkages were intact*
- I checked the left rear fuselage for warped panels
	- *Nothing to report*
- I checked the baggage door
	- *Door was secured*
- At this point, I returned to the cabin to grab the fuel tester
	> **Note:** *Going forward, I think I'll consolidate the exterior inspection and fuel testing routines.*
- I tested the fuel at the left wing sump, the fuel filter sump and the left wing sump
	- *All fuel was light blue (100LL) and did not appear to contain water or particulates*
- I performed a final exterior inspection while returning the fuel tester

After I indicated that I had completed the checklist, John quickly reviewed my work and we climbed into the cockpit.

## Startup Checklist
### Pre-start
- Toggled Master Switch to On
- Toggled Avionics Switch to On
- Listened to AWOS
	- Make note of altimeter setting

- Verify fuel pressure gauge is indicating acceptable level
### Warmup
- Raise throttle to 2000RPM
	- Re-verify all gauges and vacuum
	> **Note:** *Leave throttle at 2000RPM for at least 30 seconds*
- Lower throttle to idle
### Post-start
- Disengage Fuel Pump
- Lean mixture to smooth
- Verify Vacuum
- Toggle Avionics Switch to On

## Taxiing to Runway
- Test brakes
	- Engage pedal brakes by pushing on the top of the rudder pedal
	- Slowly disengage parking brake
	- Slowly release and re-engage pedal brakes
- Request Taxi clearance from ATC
	```
	"Jeff ATC, Warrior 8248Tango on ramp, requesting taxi to runway 12"
	```
- Set heading bug to departure runway heading
- Increase throttle to 1000PM over one second to begin taxi
	> **Note:** *Taxi speed should be no faster than a brisk walk*
- Follow directional signs to run-up area of designated runway
## Run-up Procedure
- Set Parking Brake
- Set Mixture to full rich
- Increase throttle to 2000RPM
- Test warning lights
- Verify Oil Temperature gauge is indicating acceptable level
- Verify Verify Oil Pressure gauge is indicating acceptable level
- Verify Fuel Pump is disengaged
- Verify voltmeter is indicating charging
- Verify vacuum
- Check Magnetos
	- Switching from Both to Right should decrease RPMs slightly
	- Switching from Both to Left should decrease RPMs slightly
	> Note: Difference between magnetos should be no more than 50RPM
- Verify Carburetor Heat
- Decrease throttle to 1000RPM
- Verify Controls
	- Ailerons, Flaps, Rudder, Stabilator
- Verify Gauges
## Takeoff
### Pre Takeoff
- Perform Takeoff Briefing
- Perform Abort Plan Briefing
- Verify Lights
- Verify Doors and Windows
- Adjust trim for takeoff
- Taxi to Runway Hold line
- Request Takeoff Clearance from ATC
	```
	"Jeff ATC, Warrior 8248Tango on Alpha, requesting takeoff on runway 12"
	```
- Start Fuel Clock
### Takeoff
- Taxi onto runway
- Align wheel with centerline
- Increase throttle to full at 1000RPM per second
- Apply right rudder as needed
- When airspeed indicated 60kt begin rotation
- Pitch to climb at 500' per minute
- Continue climb until at pattern altitude, trimming as required
## Climbs
- Increase throttle to climb
	> **Note:** *On the backside of the power curve, this is inverted*
- As power increases, the plane will naturally increase pitch to maintain trimmed airspeed
- Trim to relieve control pressure
## Turns
- All turns require back pressure on yoke
	- This prevents a downward spiral
- Steep turns require rudder input in the direction of the turn in order to stay coordinated
	> **Note:** *This is indicated by the inclinometer*
## Descents
- Use throttle to descend
	> **Note:** *On the backside of the power curve, this is inverted*
- As power decreases, the plane will naturally decrease pitch to maintain trimmed airspeed
- Trim to relieve control pressure
## Stall Demonstration
John wanted me to see and feel a stall, so he demonstrated a leaf stall.<br />
While at cruising speed and altitude, he reduced power to idle and set the flaps when we reached. Naturally, the plane began to pitch down to increase airspeed, so he set the trim to full nose up.<br />
This lowered the airspeed further, causing the pitch to increase even more - which caused us to reach the critical angle of attack.  As expected, the wings stalled, the plane automatically pitched down to increase air speed, then pitched back up and started the cycle again.<br />
He let this happen a few times, explaining each stage as it occurred, then told me that eventually it would level out at the speed that it was trimmed for.
## Emergency Landing
Next was an emergency landing simulation.<br />
During our flight, we were headed towards a neighboring town that plays host to several farms with large fields.  Johns had me aim toward a cluster of fields and reduced the power to idle. I began pitching up to maintain altitude and get us to the best glide speed. While this was happening, he had me looking for the most suitable field to land in.<br />
We agreed on one, and began banking toward it. Once we determined we could have landed (and probably freaked out the owner of the field a bit), we increased power to full (which automatically caused a pitch increase), and started raising the flaps as we approached V<sub>FE</sub>.
## Go Around Demonstration
On our way back to KJEF, we lined up for a long straight-in final. John notified ATC at 10 miles out that we were headed in and requested clearance for a touch and go.
```
"Jeff Tower, Warrior 8248Tango, 10 mile final, requesting the option"
```
As we got closer, ATC made us aware of another plane on a significantly shorter final from the same direction, so we started actively looking for the traffic.  Once we spotted the plane, John informed ATC that we were not concerned.
```
"Jeff Tower, Warrior 8248Tango, 3 mile final, traffic in sight, no factor"
```
As we got closer, John started lowering the airspeed and extending the flaps.  After a bit, we were notified by ATC that the plane that had just landed ahead of us wasn't responding to radio calls, and hadn't announced that they were clear of the runway - and we were instructed to go around.<br />
John immediately increased the throttle to full, started raising the flaps and climbed back to pattern altitude.
## Touch and Go Demonstration
Once the traffic had cleared (I later learned that they had flooded their engine and hot to perform a hot restart), John set us up for a Touch and Go. <br />
This was pretty straight forward - basically a standard landing, but once we touched down, he immediately raised the flaps to 0°, throttled to full and followed the same pattern as the takeoff procedure from earlier.
## Pattern Manuever Demonstration
Due to the traffic earlier, I had already been through the pattern once, but hadn't seen it through to a landing yet.<br />
About midfield on our downwind leg, John started reducing the throttle to lower our airspeed to below V<sub>FE</sub>.<br />
Abeam our touchdown point, he lowered the flaps to 10° and our airspeed was around 80kt.<br />
At the 45° point, he began banking to our base leg, where he lowered the flaps to 25° and our airspeed was don to 75kt.<br />
On our turn to final, the flaps were at 40° (full) and our airspeed was around 65kt - 70kt.
## Landing Demonstration
This brought us to the landing.<br />
Our altitude was a bit high, so John pitched down - but that increased the airspeed, so we overshot his demonstration goal of stopping by taxiway A2. Once we got over the taxi way hold line, he contacted ATC and informed them that we were clear of runway 12. ATC instructed us to switch to the ground frequency for taxi instructions - which we did.<br />
## Taxiing to Parking
There isn't much to report here.<br />
John let me taxi from B to A to A1 to GA Parking where (*thankfully*) he took control to line up dangerously close to another plane.
## Debrief
After shutting things down, we packed up our headsets and headed back to the FBO to record the Hobbs and Tach readings.
# Last Thoughts
I'm happy with today.<br />
John said that he was pleased with my performance and complimented my coordination - especially considering that this was my first lesson. He also mentioned that my early ground school was paying off, because I was using terminology that was ahead of this point in the lessons as well.<br />
This was great to hear, because through my ground school and even during today's lesson, there were times where I felt like I was really not doing well at all - but I didn't have any benchmark data, so that wasn't a fair assessment on my part.<br />
John mentioned that I needed to not pay as much attention to the instruments. I'm flying under Visual Flight Rules - which means that I need to reference the ground for orientation - not a dial on the dash.

I also learned a bit about how to use ForeFlight as a logbook and flight planner.

So, for my next lesson - which is set for next week (2021-04-14) - I'm going to try to do a few things:
1. I want to study the procedures ahead of the lesson
	- Hopefully I can get a few of them committed to memory  
2. I'm going to record my flight in ForeFlight
	- Hopefully I'll have a track log to show you next time!
3. I'm going to keep my focus above the glare shield
	- Half of flying is keeping the plane in the air and the other half is enjoying the scenery - I need to do both
