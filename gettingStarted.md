# Getting Started
## Set your goals
I know, I know - this step sounds a little "motivational speaker-y", but it is actually important.<br />
You need to decide what you want to accomplish, and how quickly you want to accomplish it, because that will help inform your decisions later on.

**You know that you want to fly - that's a given.**  Let's try to answer some more detailed questions:
- What do you want to fly?
	- I want to fly Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)
		- This will require a Sport Pilot Certification
	- I want to fly Single-engine Land Aircraft
		- This will only require a Private Pilot Certification
	- I want to fly larger, Multi-engine Land Aircraft
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* a Multi-engine Rating (ME)
	- I want to fly Single-engine Sea Aircraft
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* a Sea Aircraft Rating
- When do you want to fly?
	- I'll only fly on perfect, sunny days
		- Your Sport or Private Certification will cover this
	- I want to be able to deal with poor weather
		- This will require a Private Pilot Certification *and* an Instrument Rating (IR)

> **Note:** *My CFI **highly** recommended earning an Instrument Rating - even if I was fairly certain I would only fly on perfect days. Freak weather happens (especially here in the Midwest), so he wanted me to be able to deal with it - and I completely agreed with him.*

## Choose your Instructor
Your choice of a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) is important and you may need to "interview" more than one before you find the right fit.
Here are a few things you should ask:
- How many years have you been flying?
	- How many hours?
- How long have you been an instructor?
- How many students have you had?
- What percentage of your students pass the FAA Checkride?
	- Of those, how many passed on the first attempt?
I found that most of the CFIs I spoke to answered these questions before I could even ask them - which made it a little easier on me.

## Ground School
Ground school is the classroom-style education involved with flight lessons.
You can start ground school whenever you would like, but the knowledge you gain during Ground School will be immediately applicable to your first flight lesson, so getting a jump start wouldn't be a bad thing!

There is a lot of information out there about which method is best - in-classroom or online.
Your CFI will probably have a preference, but the Online courses are extremely popular - both for the competitive price and accessibility.  In my situation, I was advised by my CFI (and others) to investigate the online options.  
*Look at the **Online Ground School** section below for more information.*

Whichever method you choose, you just need to get started. Generally, the earlier you start the better off you'll be.
If you start really early, you might require a bit of review later on - but that's okay. You want a good, solid understanding of what is in these courses.
If you went the Online Ground School route, most of the providers let you access the content as often as you want, so you can retake the practice tests as often as you would like - which will help your confidence level.
After you complete ground school and are ready to move on to the next step you'll need to take an exam - probably at a nearby testing center. When you pass the exam (which you will because you studied the material!), the results are valid for 24 calendar months, so you'll want to get your flight school completed before that date (or delay taking the test).  Worst case, you'll have to retake the exam.

### Online Ground School
In the world of Online Flight Training, there are two or three major players:
- [Sporty's Pilot Shop](https://sportys.com)
- [King Schools](https://kingschools.com)
- [Gleim Aviation](https://gleimaviation.com)

> **Note:** *My CFI recommended Sporty's, and highly recommended adding on the Instrument Rating (IR) course, so I chose [this package](https://www.sportys.com/private-and-instrument-rating-course-combo.html) ($399.00). [This other package](https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly-course-private-pilot-test-prep-online-app-and-tv.html) is slightly cheaper ($249.00), but does not include the IR Course - so if you're planning to earn your Instrument Rating, you would save money by selecting the combination package.*

## Before your first flight lesson
Check with your CFI to see if they have any specific prerequisites before your first Flight Lesson - but in my case, this list covered everything:
1. Set up a MedXpress Account
	- Navigate to https://medxpress.faa.gov/medxpress
	- Request an Account
	- Fill out an application for a **Airman Medical and Student Pilot** medical examination
	- At the end you will be issued an appointment confirmation number
      > <font color="salmon">ðŸ”´ **Keep track of this number**</font><br />
	  You will need it for your Medical Examination
2. Set up an IACRA Account
   - Navigate to https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/default.aspx
   - Start a new **Student Pilot** application
   - At the end of this application, it will suggest that you have you CFI review before submitting
   - You will be issued an FAA Tracking Number (FTN)
     ><font color="salmon">ðŸ”´ **Keep track of this ID**</font><br />
	 This identifies you to the FAA, and it will be assigned for the entirety of your aviation career. You will also need to provide this to your CFI so that they can complete your Student Pilot application.
3. Schedule and complete a 3rd Class Medical Examination
	- Navigate to https://designee.faa.gov/#/designeeLocator
	- Select an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) from the list offered in your area
	- Schedule a **3rd Class Medical Examination**, providing the appointment confirmation
	- The Examination
		- For most people, the 3rd Class Medical is a pretty easy ride and is nothing to be concerned about. In my case, I'm a relatively healthy male in my early 30s with no pre-existing conditions - other than allergies.
		- Here is what we did during my medical exam:
			- Urine Sample
			- Height
			- Weight
			- Eye Examination
			- Blood Pressure
			- Ear Examination
			- Health-related Questions

			...and that's about it! If you have pre-existing conditions, it might be a bit trickier - but most things can be dealt with.

	> **Note:** *If you want to read a long, confusing document about what your AME is actually looking for, take a look at [this](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/media/guide.pdf).<br />
	Don't worry if you don't understand it - that's what they pay the doctors for!*

## Your first flight lesson
### What to bring
Check with your CFI to see what you need to bring with you to your first lesson.  I was required to bring the following:
- Passport or Birth Certificate
- Medical Examination Results
- Pilot's Logbook
	> **Note:** *If you don't already have a Logbook, your local FBO (Fixed-base Operator) will likely have some available for purchase.<br />
	If you want to order online, something like [this](https://www.sportys.com/pilot-s-flight-logbook-and-record.html) will do.*
